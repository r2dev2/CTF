# CTF Writeups

A collection of writeups for CTFs I do as part of [Psi Beta Rho](https://github.com/pbrucla) (UCLA Cyber Frat).

I currently do Web and Misc (fan of pyjails and pcap challenges) categories.

Some blogs I really like:

* mizu.re (web) - [https://mizu.re/](https://mizu.re/)
* ankur (web) - [https://blog.ankursundara.com/](https://blog.ankursundara.com/)
* masato - [https://masatokinugawa.l0.cm/](https://masatokinugawa.l0.cm/)

Writeups that are not in this GitHub:

* [Incident Response - CSAW Quals 2023](https://pbr.acmcyber.com/2023/10/17/csaw-incident-response)
